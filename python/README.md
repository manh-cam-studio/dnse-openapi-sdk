### Overview

DNSE OpenAPI is an API-first trading platform that enables developers to integrate brokerage, trading, margin, and market data services
into their own applications.

The DNSE Python SDK provides a lightweight client for securely interacting with DNSE OpenAPI REST endpoints. It handles request
signing, authentication, and communication details, allowing developers to focus on building trading systems, automation strategies,
and investment applications.

### Installation

#### Requirements

- Python 3.8+

#### Install from PyPI

```console
pip install openapi-sdk 
```

Upgrade

### Usage

Create a `DNSEClient` instance with your API credentials:

```python
from dnse import DNSEClient

client = DNSEClient(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    api_secret="your_api_secret",
    base_url="https://openapi.dnse.com.vn",
)

status, body = client.get_accounts(dry_run=False)
print(status, body)
```

### Dry Run

Set `dry_run=True` to preview the request without sending it to DNSE servers. No network call will be executed.

```python
client.get_accounts(dry_run=True)
```

### Examples

Run any example from the `sdk/python/examples` directory:

```
python sdk/python/api/get_accounts.py
